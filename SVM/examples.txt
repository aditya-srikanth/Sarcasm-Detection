i am so glad these tax dollars are not going to something useful , like education or something .
because clearly , people who have differing political opinions from you deserve a horrible death .
i am glad you stated there would be bias because i would have no way of telling otherwise .
yup , cause having a computer or smartphone totally makes up for all those other things .
it is a good thing i carry around five stalkers at all times , just for that circumstance !
but do not forget that each car also costs the tax payers , like , a bazillion dollars .
they are just trying to create a safe space in a world full of shitlords !
but we ca not have them damn japaneses taking over our walmarts and taking all our jobs !
wow a president in th century had little formal education and an undiagnosed mental illness , shock horror !
