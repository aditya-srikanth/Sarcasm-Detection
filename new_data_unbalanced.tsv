I just got married at 29, (31 now) despite being with a different woman for 6 years prior... (The first woman never crossed my mind to marry)...(This is my wife's 2nd marriage) The "'Til Death do you part" is nowhere in the contract... A woman (or man) worthy of marriage understands this... My wife and her former mate parted ways because he wasn't holding up his end of the bargain... He lost Motivation to be employed, where he had a good at marriage... As well as decided to pursue a gender reassignment... This obviously constitutes a change to initial agreement of partnership... The "half your shit" clause is because if chosen wisely your business partner will help grow your estate and if it comes time to part ways, they worked for it as well... It's just like an LLC with a partner...	0

I think a lot of people get it wrong, here's a simple guide: **When you should offend** - When people are unfairly asserting themselves on you - When people believe in capital punishment even though it is fucked up, has been abandoned by most of the world, and doesn't act as a deterrent or save prison space or money - When people believe in flogging, amputation and other disgusting 'punishments' **When you should avoid offending** - When people have beliefs that seem silly to you but are not realistically causing problems - When you're doing it for no other reason than because you can - When it's divisive and doesn't actually help the situation (i.e., cause people to change their minds)	0
