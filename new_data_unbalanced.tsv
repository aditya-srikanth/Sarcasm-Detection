Kills don't give as much gold as before yes, but there is the gold gotten from farm, dragon and towers.. Dragons and towers give more or less a thousand gold each.. So as soon as teams see that difference, they would be demoralized.. I see in my games, even when the kill difference isn't that big, people give up and call surrender votes.. God forbid if they knew they're actually behind a couple thousand golds, people would surrender a lot more often.. People that say "gg" or "ff 20" has nothing to do with this equation.. Just like people that say "gg we lose" in champ select.. They don't count.. What counts is people that check the global golds that teams have, and immediately give up on the game.. That would dramatically reduce the amount of comebacks and hopes of it..	0

Bloat is not what you think/imply, if you have a lot of code that doesn't run, it doesn't really matter unless you plan to use the code on something with very limited storage space, what you think about bloat is inefficient and bad written code that slows down the computer -- that doesn't have to be big, it can be anything starting from a couple of stupid written code lines that run in exponential time or software that does things that you don't need, think toolbars, dozens of update checkers, but just drivers that are not in use (like many of them in Linux kernel) won't matter.	0
